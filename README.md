### Project Description

	The theme we have chosen for this project is Food and Beverage. For this particular task our group has come to an agreement to start a mock organisation. GoodFood is a non-profit organization which aims to distribute nutritious food for those in need. In relation to Sustainable Goal Development, Goal 2: Zero Hunger, we have decided to create a platform where everyone is able to help with our cause as our motto is “to care is to share”.

	Our website consists of five main pages which are home, about us, donate, volunteer and contact. We have chosen three main fonts which are poppins, open sans and league spartan. The whole concept for this website is minimalist yet fresh and straight-to-the-point for easy navigation to all users. The background colour is white and the elements used are colourized with colours like red, blue, yellow, and green for an extra pop of colour.

	For the organization flow, we have several steps in managing our organization. Firstly, we manage our registration part by allowing the users to register to be involved in our food donation project. Further step in completing the registration part is entering the amount of payment that the users will donate. After that, the users must make sure to do a confirmation about the accuracy of the details filled in the registration page. The steps mentioned above must be followed accordingly in order for the application to be approved.

	Our website also provides a volunteer page which can be used to encourage people especially for the youth to be involved in the donation project. In addition, the activities in volunteering includes managing the money gain from the payment donation that will be used to make foods to be distributed and at the same time we also accept food to be donated. Moreover, people volunteering in this project will also gain soft skills such as communication skills, teamwork and time management to be applied in daily life.
